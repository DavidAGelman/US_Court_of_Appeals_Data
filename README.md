Code to create judge-case observations for the Songer Court of Appeals Database

Written in conjunction with [Doug M. Johnson] (http://www.dougmjohnson.com), this code details the process of creating judge-case observations from the [Songer Court of Appeals Database] (http://artsandsciences.sc.edu/poli/juri/appct.htm).  The Songer database has been used in a number of scholarly papers interested on the U.S. Court of Appeals but the unit of interest is at the case level while many scholars are interested in judges' behavior.  This code transforms the database into a more user friendly format for those interested in judicial behavior at the appellate level.
